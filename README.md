# ScriptWriter
Write and download a movie-like script in your browser!

This tool is meant as a way to write movie senarios or scripts in a simple and easy way. I aim to keep it as simple as possible to make sure it isn't distracting. However, I'm also trying to make it feature rich, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know!

## Mistakes
I'm definitely not proficient in script writing. That's why somethings might be a bit off. If you have any suggestions, please let me know! I love to learn and improve this tool to make it easier and better for everyone to use.

## Supported line types
These are the types of lines that can be written in the script. All of them are case insensitive except for the `TEXT` and `ACTION` types.
* `NAME`: Name of the character
* `TEXT`: Text to be displayed
